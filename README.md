## A Framework for Online Learning of the Lattice Boltzmann Method's Collision Operator Using Neural Networks

**Author:** Alireza Samari

## Overview

This document describes an algorithm that integrates online learning into the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) by leveraging a neural network. The approach combines numerical simulation with a deep learning model, enabling the collision operator in the LBM to be learned and updated in real time.

## 1. Initialization

### Grid and Physical Parameters

- **Relaxation Time:**  
  tau = 0.5 + (nu / (c_s)^2)
- **Density:** rho0
- **Velocity:** u0
- **Reynolds Number:**  
  Re = (u0 * n_y) / nu
- **Simulation Domain:** A grid of dimensions (n_x, n_y).

### Initial Distribution Function

For each lattice direction i (with i in {0, 1, …, 8}):
  
  f_i(x, y, 0) = t_i * rho0   for all (x, y)

where t_i are the lattice weights.

### Lattice Constants

- **Velocity Vectors:** v_i
- **Opposite Indices:** opp(i)

## 2. Model Architecture

### Adaptive Activation

An adaptive activation function is used:

  f(x) = tanh(alpha * x)

where alpha is a learnable parameter.

### Residual Block

For an input x, the residual block performs the following computations:

1. Compute:  
   y1 = f(W1 * x)
2. Compute:  
   y2 = W2 * y1
3. Create a residual connection:  
   x_res = W_res * x
4. Combine and apply activation:  
   y = f(beta * y2 + (1 - beta) * x_res)

   where beta is learnable.

### Adaptive ResNet

An adaptive ResNet is constructed by stacking one or more residual blocks. The final output is:

  y_out = W_out * y

## 3. Main Loop (for t = 0, 1, …, T_max)

### 3.1. Macroscopic Variables

- **Density:**  
  rho(x, y) = sum over i of f_i(x, y)
- **Velocity:**  
  u(x, y) = (1 / rho(x, y)) * [sum over i of (v_i * f_i(x, y))]

### 3.2. Equilibrium Distribution

For each lattice direction i:

  f_eq_i(x, y) = rho(x, y) * t_i * [ 1 + 3*(v_i • u) + 0.5*(3*(v_i • u))^2 - 1.5*||u||^2 ]

### 3.3. Collision Step

Update the distribution for each lattice direction:

  f'_i(x, y) = f_i(x, y) - [f_i(x, y) - f_eq_i(x, y)] / tau

### 3.4. Neural Network Training

- **Input Transformation:**  
  Reshape the current state f = {f_i} into a vector form.
- **Prediction:**  
  Compute the network prediction:  
  f_hat = NN(f)
- **Loss Function:**  
  Define the mean squared error (MSE) loss as:  
  L = average((f_hat - f')^2)
- **Update:**  
  Update the network weights using an optimizer (e.g., Adam with lr = 1e-3). A learning rate scheduler (e.g., StepLR with step = 5000 and gamma = 0.8) adjusts the learning rate.

### 3.5. Streaming Step

Propagate the post-collision distribution:

  f_i(x, y) <- f'_i(x + v_ix, y + v_iy)

and apply boundary corrections:

  f_i(wall) = f_opp(i)(wall)

## Conclusion

This algorithm iteratively updates the simulation state and trains the neural network to learn the collision operator in the Lattice Boltzmann Method. The online learning approach allows for adaptive and efficient simulation, combining the strengths of numerical methods with deep learning.
