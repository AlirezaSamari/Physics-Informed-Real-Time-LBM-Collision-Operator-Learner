An adaptive, physics-informed framework integrating online learning into the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). Leveraging a deep neural network, this hybrid solver learns the collision operator in real time, blending data-driven flexibility with the rigor of the discrete Boltzmann equation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Adaptive Accuracy:** Learns deviations from the BGK collision operator in complex flow regions.
- **Online Training:** No precomputed dataset‚Äîupdates the neural collision learner at runtime.
- **Physics Constraints:** Enforces advection and collision dynamics via a custom loss function.
- **D2Q9 on GPU:** 100√ó100 grid with moving-lid boundary conditions for shear-driven flow.


## üîß Installation

   ```
   git clone this is git repository:
   https://github.com/AlirezaSamari/Physics-Informed-Real-Time-LBM-Collision-Operator-Learner.git
   cd Physics-Informed-Real-Time-LBM-Collision-Operator-Learner
   ```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

- **Domain & Lattice:** D2Q9 on a 100√ó100 grid with bounce-back walls (left, right, bottom) and a moving lid on the top.
- **Network Architecture:** `AdaptiveResNet` with:
  - Residual blocks featuring learnable activation (`tanh(Œ±x)`) and skip-weight (`Œ≤`).
  - Final linear projection to 9 velocity directions.
- **Physics-Informed Loss:**  
  - **Collision MSE:** Difference between NN‚Äëpredicted post-collision and analytic BGK reference.  
  - **Advection Residual:** Finite-difference of streaming operator.

## üîÑ Training Loop

```python
for t in range(maxIter):
    rho, u = macroscopic(fin)                    # compute density & velocity
    feq = equilibrium(rho, u)                    # analytic equilibrium
    fout = fin - (fin - feq) / tau               # BGK reference
    fin = stream_and_bounce(fout)                # streaming + bounce-back

    if t % train_interval == 0:
        # Physics-informed update
        loss = boltzmann_loss(
            model(fin_prev), fin - step, feq, v, tau
        ) + MSE(model(fin_prev), fout)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        scheduler.step()

    if t % 1000 == 0:
        visualize_velocity(u, model_predict)
```
